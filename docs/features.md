The design of the OWNER APIs has been developed with this motto in mind. 

OWNER is a features rich API, but while adding more features, we want to keep the 
[basic usages]({{ site.url }}/docs/usage/)  as simple as it could be. 

Now the OWNER API supports a long list of features:

{% include features.html %}

The design of the new features is intended to not make things more complicated: you can pick what you need and ignore 
what you don't need.

And if you need something special that is missing in OWNER, feel free to open a 
[request](https://github.com/lviggiano/owner/issues) for it.  
We'll do our best to make OWNER do what you need.
